## Website Description

![Subject's Inconsistency](document/ShareITS.JPG)

Share.its.ac.id is one of the e-learning website that ITS provide to their students. Teachers can create courses that students can enroll in this site. This website is also open for public use that other people can use. Despite of being used by public, this website has some problem in it. One of the problem is in their navigation system which is inconsistent.

![Subject's Inconsistency](document/Inconsistent.JPG)

As you notice from sidebar (right) there are only 3 courses available while in the course menu (left) you can clearly see that there is atleast 6 courses available. I noticed that when you use sidebar for navigation it will **have different URL** from using course menu for navigation. However, after further testing the website, it's still possible to accomplish the task just using the sidebar.

## Models and Annotations
### Artifact Model
The artifact model is mainly a collection of artifacts. [UXBook:237]

!["Artifact Model - 1"](document/Artifact-01.JPG)
This is how the homepage looks like. The left sidebar has too much text in one area. Or atleast don't put it in the homepage as not everyone is a Teacher. User usually do login using a form in the top right corner. 

!["Artifact Model - 2"](document/Artifact-02.JPG)
User can access this page by using "Dashboard" menu in the user drop down field. The side navigation didn't show the list of possible class that usualy be found in other page.

!["Artifact Model - 3"](document/Artifact-03.JPG)
This is the result of searching teknologi bergerak in the search form. As you can see that "Teknologi Bergerak" doesn't have any description which make it looks like it isn't one of the search result. My subject needs to perform the search atleast 2 times before she realize that it was one of the search result.

!["Artifact Model - 4"](document/Artifact-04.JPG)
This is how the page looks like inside "Sistem Informasi"'s "Semeter VII". As you can see that the side navigation and the main navigation has different contents forcing user to use the main navigation.

!["Artifact Model - 5"](document/Artifact-05.JPG)
Here is how the "Sistem Informasi" page looks like. Users seems to ignore that there is a breadcrumb in this page that can be used for quick naviation and prefer to click backward instead of using it.

### Flow Model
A flow model is a diagram giving the big picture or overview of work, emphasizing communication and information flow among work roles and between work roles and system components within the work practice of an organization. [UXBook:190]
